# Prework Study Guide Website

## Description

My motivation with building the prework study guide website was to learn how to make a website.
I built this project to aid my learning of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I am no longer completely in the dark about how to work HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I learned the mark down language. Though there is still more to learn .
